Hey,all!
  I'm Chuanbin Liu,student of IEEE FELLOW Weiping Li.You can also call me Boss Liu,in Chinese '¡ı¿œ∞Â'.
  Now, I'm committed to research on software radio and video transmission.WSVC is the intersection of them two.
  During my free time,I like running,cycling...and of course programming.
  BTW,I am still single£°
  Best Regard!
